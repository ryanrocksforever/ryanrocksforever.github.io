        <section id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Zebulon Montgomery Pike was an American brigadier general and explorer who became
                best known for the Rocky Mountain peak that now bears his name.  As a U.S. Army
                officer he led two government expeditions through the recently acquired
                Louisiana Purchase territory.  His first expedition (1805–1806) reconnoitred the
                upper reaches of the Mississippi River, while his second (1806–1807) ventured into
                what is now the American SouthwestL6-L13.  Pike later
                published a widely read account of his journeys and rose to the rank of
                brigadier general.  He served during the War of 1812 and was killed during the
                American attack on York (Toronto) in April 1813L64-L68.</p>

        <section id="early-life">
            <h2>Early Life &amp; Education</h2>
            <p>Born on 5 January 1779 in Lamington, New Jersey, Pike was the son of Isabella Brown
                and Zebulon Pike Sr.  His father had joined the Continental Army in 1775, and through
                him the family traced its lineage to Robert Pike, an outspoken critic of the
                Salem witchcraft trialsL71-L81.  The younger Pike spent much of
                his youth at frontier outposts in present‑day Ohio and Illinois, then the
                northwestern boundary of the young United States.  He received a commission as a
                second lieutenant of infantry in 1799 and was promoted to first lieutenant later
                that same yearL83-L87.</p>

            <h2>Marriage &amp; Family</h2>
            <p>Pike married his cousin Clarissa Harlow Brown in 1801L88-L96.  Of their
                five children, only their daughter Clarissa Brown Pike survived to adulthood;
                she later married John Cleves Symmes Harrison, son of future U.S. President
                William Henry HarrisonL88-L96.  Pike was also the great‑granduncle of
                Medal of Honor recipient Emory Jenison PikeL88-L96.</p>

        <section id="career">
            <h2>Military Career</h2>
            <p>Early in his military career Pike served at various frontier posts, working in
                logistics and payroll.  He came under the patronage of General James Wilkinson,
                who had been appointed governor of the Upper Louisiana Territory by President
                Thomas JeffersonL97-L107.  In 1796 Pike accompanied French officer
                Georges Henri Victor Collot on a reconnaissance of the Mississippi valley, an
                assignment that gave him valuable experience in mapping and explorationL97-L107.</p>

            <h2>Exploratory Expeditions</h2>

            <h3>First Expedition (1805 – 1806)</h3>
            <p>In the summer of 1805, General Wilkinson ordered Lieutenant Pike to locate the
                northern source of the Mississippi River, explore the northern Louisiana Territory
                and expel British and Canadian fur traders operating illegally in the region.
                Pike left St. Louis on 9 August 1805 in a pirogue.  On 21 September he
                negotiated the Treaty of St. Peters with Dakota leaders at the confluence of the
                Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, acquiring the future site of Fort SnellingL112-L124.
                After establishing a winter camp at the Swan River, the party continued
                upriver on foot, visiting British North West Company posts and informing traders
                that they were now subject to U.S. lawL124-L132.  Pike persuaded Ojibwe
                chiefs to relinquish British medals and flags, hoisted the new fifteen‑star
                American flag and, during a side trip to Upper Red Cedar (Cass) Lake,
                designated that lake as the upper source of the MississippiL132-L145.  He
                returned to St. Louis on 20 April 1806, completing the second U.S. government
                expedition into the newly acquired western territoriesL146-L152.</p>

            <h3>Second Expedition (1806 – 1807)</h3>

            </figure>
            <p>Upon returning from his first journey, Pike was ordered to lead a second
                expedition into the Southwest to explore the headwaters of the Arkansas and
                Red Rivers, survey natural resources and foster relations with Native
                communities.  The broader purpose was to gather intelligence in case of a
                future American campaign against Spanish territories in New Mexico and TexasL159-L169.
                Beginning 15 July 1806, Pike’s party travelled west; in November they sighted
                a high mountain that he attempted to climb.  Deep snow forced the men to turn
                back at Mount Rosa, but the peak, later named <em>Pikes Peak</em>, became a symbol
                of the expeditionL172-L175.  Continuing southward, the group
                inadvertently crossed into Spanish territory and built a winter fort.  On
                26 February 1807 Spanish authorities arrested Pike and his men, escorting them
                first to Santa Fe and then to Chihuahua.  While treated courteously, the men
                were held as prisoners and their papers were confiscatedL177-L190.
                Pike used the detention to study Spanish maps and learned of growing discontent
                in colonial MexicoL194-L200.  Released at the Louisiana border on
                1 July 1807, he returned to the United States with extensive knowledge of the
                SouthwestL200-L203.</p>

        <section id="war1812">
            <h2>War of 1812</h2>
            <p>Pike was promoted to captain during his second expedition and later fought at
                the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 under General and future president William Henry
                HarrisonL204-L210.  He rose to colonel in July 1812 and served
                as deputy quartermaster‑general in New Orleans and inspector general during
                the latter stages of the War of 1812L204-L213.  Promoted to
                brigadier general in March 1813, Pike commanded the advance guard of the
                American force that captured York (now Toronto) on 27 April 1813.  As his troops
                approached Fort York, the departing British garrison detonated its powder
                magazine; Pike was mortally wounded by falling debris and died on the fieldL214-L226.
                His body was brought home and interred at the military cemetery in Sackets
                Harbor, New YorkL224-L226.</p>

        <section id="papers">
            <h2>Confiscated Papers &amp; Writings</h2>
            <p>During his captivity in New Spain, Spanish authorities seized Pike’s journals
                and maps.  Although not recovered by the United States until the 20th century,
                Pike reconstructed much of his work from memory and published <em>The
                    Expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike …</em> in 1810L229-L239.  The
                book became extremely popular—translated into Dutch, French and German—and
                provided American explorers with valuable information about trade routes and
                the future Santa Fe TrailL229-L240.  Pike’s Spanish detention also
                gave him insight into political unrest in Chihuahua and the broader Spanish
                SouthwestL242-L245.  A legend known as “The Lost City of
                Palanor,” which involves an alleged treasure and a hidden pre‑Columbian city,
                has been attributed to missing sections of his journalsL247-L253.</p>

        <section id="legacy">
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>In the years following his death, Pike’s military exploits were celebrated
                through biographies, memorials, paintings, poems and songsL256-L261.
                Numerous towns, counties and ships were named in his honour and natural
                features—including Pikes Peak, the second most‑visited mountain in the
                world—memorialize his exploratory achievementsL264-L266.  His
                expedition route of roughly 3,664 miles is maintained today by the Pike
                National Trail AssociationL266-L267.  Although his fame waned
                after the Civil War, it rebounded during the 1906 centennial of his
                Southwestern expedition.  He is commemorated by a marble statue at the
                Antlers Hotel (erected 1901) and a bronze medallion in Monument Valley Park in
                Colorado Springs (1926)L269-L273.  Historians continue to debate
                whether Pike was primarily an explorer or served covertly as a spyL272-L275.</p>
