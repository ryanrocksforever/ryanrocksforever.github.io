    <h1>Why Universal Design Matters</h1>
    <p class="tagline">The web was built for everyone. Let's keep it that way.</p>

    <section class="ud-section">
      <h2>The Digital Divide is Real</h2>
      <p>Over <strong>1 billion people</strong> worldwide live with some form of disability. That's roughly 15% of the global population. When we design websites that exclude these users, we're not just being inconsiderate—we're actively building barriers in a space that was meant to be open to all.</p>
      <p>Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, said it best:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."</p>
        <cite>— Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
      </blockquote>

    <section class="ud-section">
      <h2>It's Not Just About Disability</h2>
      <p>Universal design benefits <em>everyone</em>, not just people with permanent disabilities. Consider these scenarios:</p>
      <ul class="benefit-list">
        <li><strong>Situational limitations:</strong> Trying to use your phone in bright sunlight, or watching a video in a quiet library</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary impairments:</strong> A broken arm, an eye infection, or recovering from surgery</li>
        <li><strong>Aging population:</strong> Vision, hearing, and motor skills naturally decline as we age</li>
        <li><strong>Slow connections:</strong> Users in rural areas or developing countries with limited bandwidth</li>
        <li><strong>Different devices:</strong> From smartwatches to screen readers to gaming consoles</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you design for accessibility, you're designing for your future self too.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="ud-section">
      <h2>The Business Case</h2>
      <p>Beyond ethics, there are compelling business reasons to embrace universal design:</p>
      <div class="stat-grid">
        <div class="stat-card">
          <span class="stat-number">$13T</span>
          <span class="stat-label">Annual disposable income of people with disabilities globally</span>
        </div>
        <div class="stat-card">
          <span class="stat-number">71%</span>
          <span class="stat-label">of users with disabilities leave websites that aren't accessible</span>
        </div>
        <div class="stat-card">
          <span class="stat-number">98%</span>
          <span class="stat-label">of homepages have detectable WCAG failures</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Accessible websites also tend to have better SEO, faster load times, and improved usability for all users.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="ud-section">
      <h2>Legal Requirements</h2>
      <p>Web accessibility isn't just a nice-to-have—it's increasingly the law:</p>
      <ul class="benefit-list">
        <li><strong>ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act):</strong> Courts have ruled that websites are "places of public accommodation"</li>
        <li><strong>Section 508:</strong> Federal agencies must make electronic content accessible</li>
        <li><strong>WCAG:</strong> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are the international standard</li>
        <li><strong>EAA (European Accessibility Act):</strong> Takes effect in 2025 for EU member states</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lawsuits related to web accessibility have increased dramatically. Don't let your site become a liability.</p>

      <h2>Be Part of the Movement</h2>
      <p>The web has always evolved through grassroots movements demanding change. CSS Zen Garden revolutionized design. Web standards brought consistency. HTML5 semantics improved content structure.</p>
      <p><strong>Universal design is the next frontier.</strong></p>
      <p>As the next generation of web developers and designers, you have the power to shape a more inclusive internet. Every accessible website you build is a step toward a web that truly works for everyone.</p>
